# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

## Description 

This project creates a timed quiz that utilizes Bootstrap styling and JavaScript functionality. The user is presented with several choices for each question, and if the correct answer is chosen, the score will update. If the user selects no answer or an incorrect answer, their time will be penalized by ten seconds. Upon completion of the quiz, the user is prompted to input their initials, which are then added to the highscores page. The user can view all recent highscores or choose to clear them. The quiz can be completed any number of times, but only the top five scores are saved.
